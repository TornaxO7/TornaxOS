# Welcome!
Welcome to my little repository where I'm trying to implement my own kernel!
I'm a completely newbie but I hope to learn a lot from this *huge* project! :)

# Branches
I have different branches, each of them has a different history during my
attempts. Here's a more detailed description of each branch usage:

- `main`: Will be the active branch, where I'm developing currently
- `manual`: The first branch, where I tried to write everything on my own with
only a few copy+paste stuff like the VGA colors, the rest is completely self
written!
- `osdev_attempt`: I looked up many stuff from osdev *but I did not just copy
and paste their stuff!*
